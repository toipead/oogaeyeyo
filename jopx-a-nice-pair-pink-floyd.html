Hello, I wanted to take a few minutes to create this post for others in the community who may find themselves disappointed with their decision to pick up an HD6XX from Massdrop.

Vérité Review Some photos: https://imgur.com/gallery/ouI1Nw9 Truth in Music: The Vérité is the new ZMF flagship, and is being released as one of two new entrants into the company’s open-backed, over-ear dynamic lineup. The Vérité brings several technical firsts to ZMF’s headphones, perhaps most excitingly, an entirely new driver material, comprised of beryllium deposed onto a polyethylene naphthalate dome. Other improvements include a magnesium chassis, a stiffer surround, porting. Внимание, перед принятием решения о покупке настоятельно рекомендуем просмотреть тему форума "Барахолка - положительные и отрицательные отзывы". So the only headphones I’ve ever owned were either cheap earbuds or the knock of beats my ex bought me, and I really want a pair of headphone that will give me an amazing sense of immersion. My budget is 400$ USD, but I can budge on that if there’s something more expensive that would better suit me. I listen to a lot of metal and rock, but my musical tastes range all over the place. Bands like Metallica, Pink Floyd, Rage against the machine, Pearl Jam, cage the elephant, but really I could liste. Текущая цена: (14 ставки): 505 грн. Стартовая цена: 400 грн.

A bit of a background story: I first got into psychedelics a few years ago after stumbling upon an article on Facebook about the healing properties of mushrooms for PTSD sufferers. I read it and found it fascinating, how years of therapy and anti-depressants did nothing in comparison to one trip with a therapist to guide them.
